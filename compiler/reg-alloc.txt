## Stages ##

@[file:reg-alloc-model-check.stanza]
  Checks whether models and programs are wellformed before we begin operation.

## IR Definition ##

@[file:reg-alloc-ir.stanza]
  Defines the fundamental IR for representing register allocation problems.

## Utilities ##

@[file:reg-alloc-datastructures.stanza]
  Fast datastructures tuned for use by the register allocator.

  ResourceProvider: All fast datastructures used by the register allocator are
  created using a ResourceProvider. So any engine that requires datastructures
  should accept a ResourceProvider in its constructor.
