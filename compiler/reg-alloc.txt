## Stages ##

@[file:reg-alloc-model-check.stanza]
  Checks whether models are wellformed before we begin operation.

@[file:reg-alloc-program-check.stanza]
  Checks whether a program is wellformed with respect to a set of models
  before we begin operation.

@[file:reg-alloc-add-temp-vars.stanza]
  Preprocessing stage that adds temporary variables and set statements
  to the program such that repeated vars are not used in operations.

## IR Definition ##

@[file:reg-alloc-ir.stanza]
  Defines the fundamental IR for representing register allocation problems.

## Interfaces ##

@[file:reg-alloc-model-env.stanza]
  Defines ModelEnv, an abstract interface that provides information about models.
  Passes/operations that require information about models retrieve it through this interface.

## Utilities ##

@[file:reg-alloc-datastructures.stanza]
  Fast datastructures tuned for use by the register allocator.

  ResourceProvider: All fast datastructures used by the register allocator are
  created using a ResourceProvider. So any engine that requires datastructures
  should accept a ResourceProvider in its constructor.
