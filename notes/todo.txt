- Prevent package qualified symbols from being binders.
- Hashtable needs update function
- Bools instead of True|False
- Figure out why the following is not inferrable:
     f: (x:A, y:B) -> C
     map: <?T,?S> (f:T -> ?S, x:?T) -> S
     map: <?T,?S> (f:T -> ?S, x:List<?T>) -> List<S>
     x: A
     y: List<B>
     map(f{x, _}, y)
- Call primitive special forms should give a proper error if not a
  recognized primitive.
- LoStanza defmethod
- Weak References : Flag indicates whether the link to the object is
  the only link to the object. (Then toss away the weak reference when
  done).
- Labels and Gotos: Front end must check that variables are never used
  before they are defined. (Because of labels/gotos this is harder
  than a simple scope check). OR restrict the use of labels and gotos.
- Measure statistic: How much are we suffering from unbounded growth
  of type objects? (We can limit this using a counter if necessary).
  e.g. defn* f<T> (...) :
          f<T|Int>(...)
- Need an implementation of Sets.
- defmulti with no arguments should not crash Stanza.
- Issue proper error messages if defmulti is followed by superfluous
  colon.
- Ensure that multifns have differing arity branches.
- LoStanza deref of a HiStanza type should know the expected LoStanza
  type so that multifns can be derefed appropriately.
- match(s) :
      (s:DefWire|DefMemory) : ...
      (s:DefMemory) : ...
   stanza errors very ungracefully with "Duplicate label gen719903."
- sum/product for Floating point arrays
- Check for overflow
- Switch with single else clause gives strange parser error.
- Clean up parser system:
     - No scoping
     - Suffix ops are difficult
     - No types
     - Escape character is weird
     - Error conditions are clunky
     - The following pattern is very difficult to specify because the
       trailing arguments also happen in #exp production.
          callc ?e:#exp (@do ?args:#exp)
     - Fast stop when tagged with primitive form clumsy.
- Carriage Returns and Tabs should issue proper errors in Lexer
- Literal tuples of enormous lengths should be compiled specially.
- Why do the following statements need to be surrounded with
  parenthesis?
  
  if #I(xt) : (RE() when not (#I(yt) or #F(yt)))
  else if #L(xt) : (RE() when not (#L(yt) or #D(yt)))
  else if #F(xt) : (RE() when not (#I(yt) or #F(yt)))
  else if #D(xt) : (RE() when not (#L(yt) or #D(yt)))
  else : RE()

  implement is-equal? for tables/vectors based on them.
- Can't declare argument with Void types.
- Underscore in binders means to ignore. (Avoid redundant definitions).
- LoStanza Assignments to HiStanza variables need to be checked.

- /Users/psli/Docs/Programming/stanza3/core/core.stanza:3169.11: Cannot access field items in expression of type ref<[Int, Int]>.
- Inference bug:
      val flag = get(BLOCK-DEFS, new Int{b.value * v.value})
      println(modulo(BLOCK-DEF-MSG, new Tuple{3, b, v, flag}))
  WORKS, BUT:    
      println(modulo(BLOCK-DEF-MSG, new Tuple{3, b, v, get(BLOCK-DEFS, new Int{b.value * v.value})}))
  GIVES:    
      compiler/stz-bb.stanza:937.55: Could not capture type argument T for function
      get of type <?T> . (ref<IndexedCollection<?T>>, ref<Int>) -> ref<T>.
      Called with arguments of type (ref<BitArray>, ref<Int>).
- Precedence of not needs to change to allow: not x and not y 
- Using new as name for variable gives strange error.
- Query stanza installation directory from commandline.
- stanza extend
- Make sure STANDARD-OUTPUT-STREAM and STANDARD-INPUT-STREAM are not
  actually FileOutputStreams. 
- Ambiguous branch: Needs MUCH BETTER ERROR MESSAGES!

- Say which argument is the wrong type when calling function with
  wrong arguments.

- multis should jump to methods for proper tail recursion
- Double check that [] collapses to Tuple<Void>
- Give labeled scope function a name for better error messages.
- dynamic-wind needs to work on uninitialized variables.
- printf variable arguments should have byte, float upcasted appropriately automatically.
- implement more of the C calling convention.
- switch(x) : branch syntax for using the == operator.
- smaller memory footprint for calling cc.

- on-finalize feature for Hi and Lo deftype constructs. Allows
  tree-shaker to detect which fields can be removed and which
  can't. Also a fair bit simpler to use.
