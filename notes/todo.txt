- Prevent package qualified symbols from being binders.
- Hashtable needs update function
- Hashtable needs default value/function
- Bools instead of True|False
- Figure out why the following is not inferrable:
     f: (x:A, y:B) -> C
     map: <?T,?S> (f:T -> ?S, x:?T) -> S
     map: <?T,?S> (f:T -> ?S, x:List<?T>) -> List<S>
     x: A
     y: List<B>
     map(f{x, _}, y)
- Checking language needs to be fixed to deal with after-clauses when
  included via plus clauses.
- Check that lostanza struct fields are unique.
- Check that multis have different arities for branches.
- Check that parametric types have correct arity.
- Lower bounds for type constraint solver.
- Tuple needs to be collapsed for subtyping and flow relations.
- "this" needs to have a type during inference.
- Ensure nested tuple destructuring works. Currently it doesn't.
======================================================
- Return 0/1 from compiler for success/fail
- Call Stanza from LoStanza
- Package Format
- Core/Verse Cleanup
- Macro system scoping/exporting
- Byte|Int|Long|Float|Double lexer values
