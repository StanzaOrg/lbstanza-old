               ==================================            

On March 16, we will be starting the second bootcamp for teaching
functional programming using the Stanza programming language and
invite all who are interested to come! 

If you've found yourself curious about all the recent buzz surrounding
functional programming, but was intimidated by the steep learning
curves of ML or Haskell, then consider trying out Stanza. Stanza is a
brand new general-purpose programming language designed by Patrick
S. Li, from Jonathan Bachrach's group in Berkeley.

Stanza is a beginner friendly but powerful language, and bridges the
gap between historically very different programming paradigms:

  - Stanza offers a seamless integration of traditional
    object-oriented programming and functional programming. You gain
    the expressive power of functional programming but with the
    architectural power and familiarity of object oriented
    programming. 
    
  - Stanza's optional type system provides a smooth transition from
    dynamically typed scripting languages to statically typed
    production languages. This allows you to prototype your
    application without declaring any types and have Stanza behave
    just like Python/Ruby. Then when you're ready to turn your
    application into a polished product, you can incrementally add
    types to catch more and more errors upfront and bulletproof your
    program.

You should come check out Stanza if any of the following applies to you:

   - You program predominantly in a scripting language
     (eg. Ruby/Python/Javascript) and are increasingly annoyed by the
     amount of time wasted chasing down silly typos and mistakes.

   - You program predominantly in a production language (eg. Java) and
     are annoyed at just how much code you have to write, and find
     yourself missing the productivity of scripting languages.

   - You're curious about functional programming but it has always
     seemed too hard to learn.

Participants should bring a laptop with a Unix-based operating
system to code along.

Hope to see you there.
  - Patrick and Jonathan
