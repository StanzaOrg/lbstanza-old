               ==================================            

On March 28, we will be starting the second course on teaching
functional programming using the Stanza programming language and
invite all who are interested to come!

If you've found yourself curious about all the recent buzz surrounding
functional programming, but was intimidated by the steep learning
curves of ML, Haskell, or Scala, then consider trying out
Stanza. 

Stanza is a new general-purpose programming language designed by
Patrick S. Li, from Jonathan Bachrach's group in Berkeley, and aims to
be the world's most productive programming language for the entire
product development lifecycle. With Stanza, we intend for
users to be able to explore their domain space, rapidly develop
initial prototypes, and evolve their prototypes into stable robust
products, all within the same language. This is made possible by two
important technical contributions: a novel optional type system that
bridges the gap between dynamically typed scripting languages (like
Python/Ruby/Javascript) and statically typed production languages
(like Java/C++), and a novel multimethod based object system that
enables users to seamlessly blend traditional object oriented
programming with functional programming paradigms. Mostly importantly,
Stanza is designed to be easy and fun to learn.

The course will consist of 6 sessions of 1.5 hour hands-on lectures
spread across 2 weeks. Participants are encouraged to bring a laptop
with a unix-based operating system and code along. We will cover
functional programming, how to architect programs using types and
multimethods, coroutines, macros, as well as some of Stanza's more
advanced features.

You should come check it out if any of the following applies to you:

   - You program predominantly in a scripting language
     (eg. Ruby/Python/Javascript) and are increasingly annoyed by the
     amount of time wasted chasing down silly typos and mistakes.

   - You program predominantly in a production language (eg. Java) and
     are annoyed at your lack of productivity, and have the hazy
     feeling that "you can think faster than your language". 

   - You find that none of the existing languages are as productive as
     you would like and are looking for alternatives.

   - You're curious about functional programming but it has always
     seemed too hard to learn.

Please RSVP at http://when2meet.com/?4570611-xAv64 if you're
interested in coming, so that we may book an appropriate room. And
please forward this message to anyone you think may be interested.

Hope to see you there!
